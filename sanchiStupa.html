                <img src="asset/sanchi-stupa/Sanchi-Stupa-main-image.jpg">
                <p>Surrounded by the ruins of smaller stupas and monasteries, Sanchi Stupa is an architectural marvel in
                Sanchi, believed to house the relics of Lord Buddha. Also known as the Great Stupa, this famous
                pilgrimage site in India was built by the Indian Emperor Ashoka, the Great in the 3rd century BC.</p>

                <p>As the oldest stone sculpture of the country, this UNESCO World Heritage Site takes you back in the days
                of the prosperous Mauryan Era. There are four intricately designed gateways surrounding the Stupa known
                as toranas, each individually symbolizing the four emotions of love, peace, courage and trust.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history">
                <p>The Sanchi Stupa, located in Madhya Pradesh, India, is one of the oldest and most well-preserved
                    Buddhist monuments in the country. It was originally commissioned by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd
                    century
                    BCE to house the relics of Lord Buddha. The stupa was later expanded and embellished during the
                    Shunga
                    and Satavahana dynasties (2ndâ€“1st century BCE), who added the intricately carved toranas (gateways)
                    and
                    a larger dome.</p>

                <p>The Sanchi Stupa became an important center of Buddhist learning and pilgrimage, but its significance
                    declined after the decline of Buddhism in India. The site remained largely abandoned until it was
                    rediscovered by British officer General Taylor in 1818. Today, it is recognized as a UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site and stands as a testament to ancient Buddhist art and architecture.</p>
